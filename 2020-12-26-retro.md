Project retro for a client I just wrapped up.

* [Amazon Workspaces](https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces) suck. Use Cloud9 or better yet EC2 Batch custom instances. Okta is ok. Atlassian JIRA is a new level of Dante's inferno.

* ARM is going to eat x86 fast. Start removing x86 dependencies like old javascript engines now.

* Desktop Angular + Android + iOS is a *lot* of waste. Go mobile web first, perhaps even CLI/Alexa first.

* Cypress is limited. It needs to be paired with something like Puppeteer for multi-session incognito tabs.

* Use component libraries and a modicum of TLA+/Alloy in any GUI client. Keep the core data path simple.

* Use some TLA+/Alloy server side - especially for rules on destructive updates and organization roles.

* Many clients use ActiveDirectory - you should probably support it. 

* Don't host your own RabbitMQ - use SQS for worker scheduling.

* Use cgroups for unprivlidged Rails workers that handle media files - and better yet do media processing off box in unprivlidged AWS Lambda workers.

* Don't bolt on logging/metrics as an afterthought. Do compress/encrypt logs and batch to EFS/S3. Do use distributed tracing headers. Do keep metrics on end to end tests to catch regresssions earlier.

* Rebuild your Rails server at least once a month. Do use performance guided optimization. Do use SQLite3 as a local data tier where it makes sense.

* Have at least one Rust/C++/Go backed endpoint that Rails shells out to, or is statically/dynamically linked. Even if this is addition of two numbers.

* Use Postgresql RDS over MySQL RDS. Have a small localhost Postgresql instance where it makes sense to shard. Especially if you need DB side computation or custom column types.

* Build your Rails server with a robust QA api for CRUD access to user accounts in development. Keep eBPF etc endpoints available for ad-hoc production queries. Do more integration testing on localhost.

* Dogfood your own product. Team comms should have been off a feature toggled instance of the core product instead of Slack/JIRA.

* Onboard with a full stack tour of the product under a feature toggle. Back end that adds you to the list of developers. Front end that styles your card in your favorite CSS. Image stored to your media tier.

* Do randomized remote pair programming one day every two weeks.  

* Have a monorepo that git submodules all your projects so they are in one spot for cross project testing.
