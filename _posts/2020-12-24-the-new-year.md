Some goals for the new year.

* redocker.com at food/rent money generation per month. At a grad student lifestyle that is probably $2k/month profit.

* Iowa USATF/Games Masters Champion in the 200m. Meal prep + Clyde Hart template + adequate sleep. Add in a dash of Texas Method, light box squat, leg extensions, and box jumps. Also like to rabbit the first 800m of the Drake Relays masters.

* In talks with a publisher for something around AWS Cloudshell and Makefile driven devops - testing with cgroups to avoid Docker hell - eBPF/strace POSIX level expectations. 

* Rewrite endoscope in C++/Rust to take arbitrary LLVM IR.

* Burn a few thousand $$$ on OEIS sequences I've been meaning to generate.

* Get s3shell out the door in harmony with AWS Cloudshell - feed it your api key/signed s3 URIS - to does the shell commands on AWS Lambda/batch_spot massively in parallel.

* Make Ruby Great Again. Overhaul of Array/Hash to get C++/Rust performance on native types. Adding suffix arrays to String.

* Formal specification of a few UNIX tools for uutils/coreutils.

* Proof of concept on eBPF powered paramaterized system calls just like we now do paramaterized SQL queries.

* A devilish idea for a linter that will generate a lot of CVEs on base type conversion bugs.

* A port of JHipster for Rails/Django/Alexa targets.

* A POC for using Puppeteer incognito tabs to drive every cloudshell region so I have enough RAM/cores to get real work done. 

* A testing framework on top of Puppeteer for mutli-user test patterns + some Alloy/TLA+ templates so spec driven design becomes approchable to business analyists.

* A Valiant/CYK parser targeting the new Apple Neural Engines.

* Commercialize my AWS task graph scheduler.

* A custom WSL2 kernel distro for AWSLinux.
