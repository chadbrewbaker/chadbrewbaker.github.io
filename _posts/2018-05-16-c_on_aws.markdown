I now have GCC working on AWS Lambda.

Thanks to [Abhishek Patnia](https://becominghuman.ai/running-deep-learning-models-on-aws-lambda-cfd2f76ca048) I was able to get most of the way there.

A few tweaks were required. 

Refer to the [current lambda docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/current-supported-versions.html) for the latest recommended AMI which is currently amzn-ami-hvm-2017.03.1.20170812-x86\_64-gp2.

The most vexing hangup was gathering additional static libraries from /usr/lib64/.

One helpful trick was piping stdio/stderr out to a file as the Python AWS Lambda handler wrapper was really not happy about nonzero return values.

```bash
gcc -v hello.c 2> any_errors
```
