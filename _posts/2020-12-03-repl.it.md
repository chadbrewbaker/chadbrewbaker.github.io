# [REPL.it](https://repl.it/) Review

Environment is Ubuntu 18.04 on GCP, kernel build is 5.4.0-1019-gcp. A curl to [ipapi.co](https://ipapi.co/) geolocates the instance to a Mountain View data center.

The network pulls from Github at 4-7 MiB/s, not too bad. Only 1024MB disk so it can't pull llvm-project. 

Full network connectivity - so nothing stopping you from doing remote compiles.

Due to the limited disk space you might have to run [sparse git checkouts](https://github.blog/2020-01-17-bring-your-monorepo-down-to-size-with-sparse-checkout/).

No perf, and I didn't see kernel headers in the instance. Can't run apt-get to pull packages so you are on your own. No userspace linux brew.

All in all a nice offering for hello world style proofs of concept and small libraries. It's a good alternative to Google Colab if you do not Python.
